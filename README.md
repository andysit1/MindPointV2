# Mind Point

This is a cute mindmap tool I made with Raylib to understand how notes and objects work together. By
creating this I learned about design theories, linked list, and basics of makefiles for compiled languages in this case c++.

Currently this application can make notes, connect them inorder, and have a text that is able to change on hover. Eventually, I want to add more functions like being able to delete notes, a menu to change resolution of canvas, and be able to scroll/move around the canvas instead of being a static page.

This project will likely take a long time as the purpose is to learn about development cycling behind applications. May be pushed to a easier language like python so I can develop quicker and figure out better structure for application.
